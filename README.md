# Silicon22-Sim
Program to simulate the production, decay, and detection of Silicon-22 in a Monte Carlo fashion. Contains 4 directories. Three of these correspond to different nuclei produced and their subsequent proton decay modes. The 4th directory, simlib, contains all of the classes needed by the main files. Make sure the Makefile points to the right simlib location.
